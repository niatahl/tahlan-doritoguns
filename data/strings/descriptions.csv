#Weapons,,,,,
IndEvo_cryoartillery,WEAPON,"""We were able to replicate the weapon's core from a molecular scan and it appears to be functional, though we remain clueless as to how it actually operates. It might well violently implode at any moment, but for now we managed to hook it up to a pair of accelerator rails and initial tests show it to be working at just above 2/3 of the original's measured output.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Snowblind",,
IndEvo_degrader,WEAPON,"""While the weapon has proven functional, the actual performance fell well below anticipated levels. For some reason it refuses to draw sufficient power before discharge and the project lead decided to leave it at that after one of the techs got disintegrated trying to find the cause. The new plan is to scale down the frame to just what is needed to hit the apparent draw cap.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Spitfire",,
IndEvo_causalitygun,WEAPON,"""So we finally fixed the cascading energy fluctuations that had been plaguing us all week, or rather they seem to have fixed themselves. The power supply guys said they had an idea, wanted to make some adjustments later today, so it wasn't them either. With how little we understand about these components we're working with, it wouldn't surprise me if it's just some weird moon phases.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Eureka",,
IndEvo_pulsedcarbine,WEAPON,"""With the catastrophic side effects of capacitor charge processes near the core unit, we have decided to shift to an entirely different system of simply supplying new capacitor units to the weapon with ammo feeders. This seems to avert the issues entirely so far, but there is no way we will ever be able to match the peak demands of the system this way.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Parallax",,
IndEvo_riftgun,WEAPON,"""Work with the blackbox device has proven dangerous, to say the least. We've had multiple cases of these rift things appearing out of thin air while the device was under power prior to fitting the regulator unit and someone lost a finger to one of those things. Got lucky, if you ask me. We'll attempt fitting the focusing unit tomorrow, now that our measured output levels have stabilised in a weaponisable range, and I pray we get some good results before project lead gets pissy again.""","- Engineering Log Excerpt, Project Keyhole",,
